           Lightweight, very easy to use, yet highly customizable highscore server. As I have used sqlite, so it makes it a lot faster than using external database server. But when using Sqlite I also faced some challanges. To read about the challanges that I faced and how I tackled them, visit here - https://github.com/Souptik2001/Highscore-Server\#readme. You can also try it yourself out by clicking on the link beside the heading.\\

           I recently started with shader writing for graphics rendering and I am really enjoying it. The ability to write shaders gives you so much control over how you want your game to look. Here are some projects on shaders that I am currently working on - Portal Shader (Teleportation mechanic also implemented) - https://github.com/Souptik2001/Portal
Water shader - https://github.com/Souptik2001/Water-Shader\\
